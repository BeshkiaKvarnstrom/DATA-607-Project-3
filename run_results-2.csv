However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.
One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
- are allergic to over-engineering.
- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
love playing board and video games.
- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.
- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.

Lead customer-centric - customer leadership is the key. If a customer has a problem we don’t wait. We understand what customer needs and we tailor our services, products around the customer. It doesn’t mean that we let the customer lead us. It means that we think about the customer first
Have a growth mindset - we commit to results and growth. We are responsible for results, not for the activity or time spent. If we believe we can’t achieve a result or a job, it’s our duty to raise the voice, push back, explain what we suggest instead. We don’t see results as something static - ever. This means that our results and expectations are becoming more ambitious, quarter over quarter. We constantly evolve
Challenge, inspire, respect - we are the challenger in the marketplace. When working with each other - or with customers - we enjoy and desire to challenge each other. We listen, reflect, and respond. We aim to understand the point of view of the other party and if there is customer merit in the argument. When we challenge, we articulate our hypothesis clearly and provide data and evidence in our argumentation. We respect the time of our colleagues. We have a zero-tolerance towards discrimination of any kind. We respect the environment
Execute systematically - We recognize that the start-up journey will only be successful if we learn twice as much as others in half the time. For us, innovation also means continuous improvement in all fields. We think in systems when driving results, growth, and learnings
Act with urgency - We have a sense of urgency in everything we do - at all times. It’s deeply rooted in the belief that as an up-start, as a challenger, we need to drive value for our customers faster and better than anybody else in the marketplace. We do things outside of the personal comfort zone."

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.
From Our Client
We are seeking a Data Scientist to join our investments team. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibility will be to interpret on-chain data and provide data-driven insights that power investment decisions. This will involve owning all parts of our data science tech stack:
1) Working closely with our engineering team to build efficient ETL pipelines
2) Building tools and frameworks to provide scalable data-driven insights
3) Producing data-driven reports to supplement investment decisions
The essence of the role is to live at the bleeding edge of interpreting on-chain crypto data. For the first time in history, all of the data related to a growing digital economy is open source and available to anyone. However, this data is messy and underexplored. The Data Scientist will be responsible for spearheading our exploration and analysis of on-chain crypto data.
There will be an emphasis on presenting analyses and findings in a digestible form that influence investment decisions. We are looking for a Data Scientist that can translate data driven insights into concise, well written reports.
We work as a cohesive team and expect everybody to think like an owner, not an agent. While the first few months will involve hands-on training, the Data Scientist must be a self starter and independent thinker who can operate with minimal supervision.
Requirements
Bachelors degree in a related field
3+ years of product/strategy-oriented data science work experience
Strong quantitative and statistical analysis background, including regression, hypothesis testing, clustering analysis, and network analysis
Proficiency using SQL, Git, and Python/R, including standard libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Tidyverse
Proven intuition of translating business problems to statistical problems
Excellent written communication
Demonstrated interest in crypto. If you cannot describe what Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DeFi are, then this role is not a fit. Ideally, you are completely obsessed with crypto
Deep curiosity, strong opinions, and intellectual flexibility. If you do not hold strong opinions and almost always agree with the consensus, then this role is not for you
No unchecked egos. We all work towards the collective success of the firm, and do not aim for individual recognition. People who care more about building their personal brands than contributing to building a world-class team need not apply.
Must live or be willing to relocate to NYC. We will be working from the office at least four days per week.

We're building the infrastructure for the net zero transition, and we're looking for brilliant builders who want to help define a low carbon future.
Decarbonizing the economy requires a granular, real-time view of where emissions come from and how they might be reduced. We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives. Having developed technology which is significant in advance of competitive solutions, we are now investing heavily in market adoption.
You can find out more about interviewing at CarbonChain at https://www.carbonchain.com/careers/interview-process.
Working at CarbonChain
To join CarbonChain, you'll be a keen team player who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we've run Amazon's European supply chain, built JustEat's corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We've got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there's a lot we don't know, and we're hoping you can help fill that gap.
We encourage every member of our team to be the best they can be, whether that's developing skills through their learning budget or participating in reading groups. Our work requires everybody to straddle the physical and digital worlds, and a growth mindset is essential.
What will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain?
As the world wakes up to the reality of climate change and the need to decarbonize, there's a pressing need to understand the carbon intensity of every activity in the economy. Your job as Data Scientist is to build the datasets, models, and pipelines we need to provide that understanding, and get insights to clients.
As the first Data Science hire in the NYC office, you'll help form the team in NYC and collaborate closely with London. Your work will directly contribute to the acquisition and success of North American clients, whilst helping to shape the product to meet the needs of a new market.
This is a role that will involve lots of contact with clients and close collaboration with the sales team. We're looking for a commercially-minded data scientist who is curious about discovering and solving customer problems.
You can expect to have:
Ownership of your projects
Extensive client exposure
The ability to make real changes with tangible business value
Our data science stack is predominantly Python. We deploy our work in a variety of ways depending upon the challenge, from Lambdas to Docker containers. A typical service might pull together a mix of data from relational and non-relational databases, train a machine learning model nightly, and expose predictions via a Lambda function. We've got a huge number of exciting things to build, from interactive visualizations of industrial processes to fluid-dynamics models of shipping emissions.
Our only must-haves are possessing a hunger to solve business challenges using technology and the ability to build close relationships with your team.
Which tools, technologies, and processes will you work with?
Data processing with the standard scientific stack (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy) and beyond
Machine learning in Sklearn and (rarely) Pytorch
Data visualization with Plotly, Maptlotlib, and Altair
Containerised applications are the key to our technology vision allowing us to replicate production environments locally and scale services at will.
Object-oriented code forms the bulk of our codebase.
PostgreSQL and DynamoDB managed databases form the persistence layer - you'll learn to navigate document and relational databases and appreciate the values in both worlds.
Infrastructure automation is owned by the whole team, helping to spread the DevOps mentality across the whole technology department (and beyond).
Testing approaches from unit testing to integration testing are key to delivering reliable and maintainable solutions.
Quality assurance is owned by the team themselves - we believe that full cycle product ownership should sit tightly within the team.
Agile development, using various approaches from Scrum to Elephant Carpaccio, helps us deliver software in small iterations, learning and course-correcting in the process to make sure we deliver the right improvements.
GitHub PRs are an integral part of our core development flow - with reviews to help share knowledge and improve quality.
Continuous delivery is the approach we strive for - with metrics that help us optimise parts of the pipeline that need it the most.
Teamwork and collaboration are fundamental to the delivery of our solutions. We encourage solutionizing between the team and the wider business.
You don't need to be a pro at all of these skills to apply for the role, but we'd love to hear about any relevant knowledge and experiences that you have in these areas.
What we require from applicants
Right to work in the US and willingness to come to the NYC office 2+ days a week
4+ years of relevant work experience
A passion for environmental issues
A demonstrated interest in building products and collaborating tightly with engineers
The grit and energy to work in an early stage startup
What we're offering
Healthcare
Competitive salary + generous equity package
Flexible working hours - we encourage regular breaks and being AFK (away from keyboard) to support your wellbeing
$2,000 annual development allowance for you to spend on developing your current skills and learning new things
Tech equipment of your choice
Regular social activities
Generous amount of holidays, 26 days of annual leave
We're striving to build a diverse team and we would love to hear from applicants from backgrounds less frequently represented in technology, be that in terms of gender, race, or professional background.

About the Data Collaborative for Justice (DCJ)
The Data Collaborative for Justice (DCJ) is a research institute launched at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in 2013. DCJ seeks to advance justice and equity through rigorous research and data-driven policy analysis on mass incarceration, racial disparities, bail reform, case backlog, pretrial diversion, low-level enforcement, and other justice reform topics. DCJ partners with reformers, think tanks, and government agencies in New York and maintains a small portfolio of partnerships around the nation. DCJ also provides technical assistance to the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice (MOCJ) of New York City to process administrative data and conduct criminal justice research, including data analysis, data engineering, and data science work. DCJ operates under the Research Foundation of the City University of New York (RF-CUNY).
About the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice (MOCJ)
The successful applicant will work closely with research, technical, and policy staff at the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice (MOCJ). MOCJ advises the Mayor of the City of New York on criminal justice policy. MOCJ develops and implements strategies to reduce crime and incarceration and promote fairness and legitimacy. MOCJ works with other city agencies, law enforcement, nonprofits, foundations, and others to implement data-driven strategies that address current crime conditions, prevent offending, and build the strong neighborhoods that ensure enduring safety. Over the past decade, the office has an extensive record of quality in-house research, funding, support for research by partner agencies, and publication of important data on criminal justice reforms and trends.
The Current Position
Overview
This position is for a Data Scientist who is capable and interested in using their analytical engineering tasks to inform NYC’s criminal justice policies under the MOCJ technical assistance project.

Ideal candidates should have a strong interest in criminal justice research, excellent data science skills, and proven expertise with commonly used data science tools, such as SQL, R, and Python. Among other data sources, the position involves working with a highly complicated relational database that integrates data from both criminal justice agencies and nonprofit service providers. The definition of success is grasping what types of measures it is essential to track and analyze; coding in SQL and R to create such measures and merge them with others to create analysis-ready datasets; and having the necessary attention to detail to create informative results that are visually and conceptually clear to policymakers and practitioners.
Although the primary assignment would be to the MOCJ project, the applicant would also likely maintain at least one assignment at all times resulting in independent DCJ research publications, with subjects along the lines of those represented under the “Our Work” tab of our website. This added work may be delayed at the start of the position to prioritize database progress for MOCJ.
We would consider a Data Scientist at multiple points on the experience spectrum, but the position requires a high coding proficiency and commitment to DCJ’s focus and mission.

Maintain and improve existing data products such as analytical reports, interactive documents, and dynamic data dashboards—with an eye to visual clarity, accuracy, and relevance to the policy issues at stake.
Identify data opportunities to support the efforts of criminal justice reform.
Design data-driven presentations and documents to translate findings to a policy audience.
Contribute to independent DCJ research publications and to conversations within the DCJ team (as well as spanning the MOCJ partnership) about future research and policy ideas.
Qualifications
Qualifications
The successful candidate must have a broad range of skills, but above all, they must be curious, flexible thinkers who love learning new things and tackling challenges on a daily basis. In addition, the successful applicant should possess the following:
Degree and experience:
Bachelor’s degree in computer science, statistics, quantitative social science (public policy, criminal justice/criminology, or sociology), or other relevant discipline with minimum three years of experience with relevant quantitative research required; OR:
Master’s degree in the one of the above fields (preferred).
Proven ability in statistical analysis and technical expertise in data mining.
Proven proficiency with SQL queries and analysis is required; knowledge of relational databases and data warehousing architecture also required; hands-on ETL development experience is a plus.
Proven proficiency with at least one statistical programming languages (R, Python) is required.
Experience with reporting and visualizing complex research products; hands-on experience with Tableau is a plus.
Experience with cloud environments (AWS, Azure) is a plus.
Excellent oral and written communication skills.
A demonstrated interest in criminal justice. Prior work in criminal justice or related social justice is a plus, as is familiarity with New York City-specific criminal justice issues, data, and research (though these latter qualifications are not absolute prerequisites).
Experience with using administrative data sets to explore complex policy questions.
Ability to balance competing priorities, complex situations and tight deadlines.
Ability to work independently in a fast-paced environment.
Ability to work comfortably with a wide variety of people at different levels of technical and research proficiency and with different backgrounds.
Work Model: Hybrid in-person and remote.
Salary: Likely range of $80,000 to $115,000. Final salary will be based on the skills and experience of the successful applicant.
Benefits: Competitive health insurance plan with vision and dental; generous annual leave time and holiday schedule; 403b and Group Retirement Annuity; Life & disability insurance, and additional benefits from the RF-CUNY system available immediately or after a period of service.

Handling over 1 trillion queries per day, our platform operates at an unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, ownership, empathy, and collaboration. We value the unique experiences and perspectives that each person brings to The Trade Desk, and we are committed to fostering inclusive spaces where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work every day.
Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a dynamic, globally-connected team where your contributions will make a meaningful difference in building a better media ecosystem? Come and see why Fortune magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among the best small-medium-sized workplaces globally.
ABOUT THE ROLE
Our Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients. As a Staff Data Scientist, you will contribute meaningfully through leading others.
Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges.
You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.
Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our Data Scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR
You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to complex, multi-layered, impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing and anticipate problems that may be several degrees removed from obvious requirements.
You make your team better by proactively advocating for and driving improvements not just to what the team produces, but also the ways in which the team works.
You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled data scientist with deep expertise working with embedded models in always-on production systems and working across a variety of technologies and data sources.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE
You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
Preferred, a BS/MS with 12 years or a PhD with 8+ years of experience working in a data-driven role. What is most important to us is what and how you can contribute though which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.
You make effective use of big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

The Roku Culture
Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

"Machine Learning Engineer","https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=adb341d491c3c741&fccid=43e8b1c3e0c763d0&vjs=3","","","$83,000 - $225,000 a year","OXMAN
OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.
At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.
We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.
This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.
Summary
OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization. The primary focus is to design, optimize, and deploy machine learning pipelines using large multimodal datasets (i.e., tabular data, images, structured/unstructured text, time series, audio, biological sequences, etc.), containing heterogeneous and complex information related to biology, design, and sustainability. Experience with the design of traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, along with a strong understanding of deep learning and the ability to build ML architectures for real-world use is desired. Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility.
The Machine Learning Engineer will play a key role in researching and developing novel algorithms, models, and methods for solving unique challenges of prediction/inference, knowledge search, and reinforcement learning within a variety of biological and bio-inspired systems—from single-celled organisms to whole ecologies and even biotic-abiotic hybrid systems, where autonomous robots may interact with biological organisms.
Core responsibilities
Lead efforts to aggregate and maintain selected multimodal datasets
Apply techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop, implement, and evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms for applications related to biology, sustainability, and environmental data
Develop machine learning models and detailed documentation to assess system performance
Develop scalable rules-based systems, classifiers, regressors, knowledge graphs, reinforcement learning systems, and other machine learning pipelines to support physical and digital projects within our organization
Conduct functional analysis, design trade studies, requirements allocation, and interface definition to translate team and client requirements into hardware and software specifications
Actively seek opportunities to publish work in top-tier journals and other platforms for diffusing scientific knowledge
Nurture and augment the scientific vision of OXMAN, upholding core design principles and ensuring the highest and most innovative quality of work
Actively partner with a multidisciplinary team of professionals, including other biologists, engineers, and designers, across scientific and design pursuits
Communicate ideas, work, and progress clearly, including by engaging in team meetings, presentations, and other creative communication outlets
Qualifications & competencies
PhD or equivalent, with a focus on computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, applied data science, bioinformatics, mathematics, physics, or relevant field
Minimum 4 years of experience with machine learning
Portfolio demonstrating out-of-the-box thinking and stellar taste in design
Fluency with programming (e.g., MATLAB, Python, Java, C++)
Ability to thrive in a fast-paced entrepreneurial environment
Excellent independence, self-motivation, organizational skills, and attention to detail
An interest in design, biology, architecture, artificial intelligence, and/or sustainability is a plus
Strong commitment to the team; maintains positive working relationships with diverse people, including internal team and external partners
Embodies ethics and integrity in all work, respecting both company and broader community policies in all conduct
