# Project 3 Part 1 Prompt 
Create a short document, with the names of group members. You should briefly describe your collaboration tool(s) you’ll use as a group, including for communication, code sharing, and project documentation. You should have identified your data sources, where the data can be found, and how to load it. And you should have created at least a logical model for your normalized database, and produced an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram documenting your database design.

# Project 3 Approach

The goal of the project is to use data to answer the question, “Which are the most valued data science skills?”. We decided to web scrap a major job search engines (ex: Indeed, Linkedin, Glassdoor, etc) for job postings. Create a large csv that contains job title, job URL, company name, job salary, and job description. Then, we will create a list of hard skills and soft skills, and find the top 5 most frequent hard skills and soft skills on the job postings. The most valued data science skills are the skills that appear most often on the job postings. 


# Data Source

Plan A:
We decided to web scrap major job search engines (Indeed, Linkedin, Glassdoor, etc). In the beginning we used the package 'rvest' on R to web scrape Indeed for job postings. However, we ran into a 403 error. There is an API restriction. So we used Parsehub and Octoparse to scrap data from the job search engine.

Plan B: 
If webscraping fail, we decide to use a dataset we found on Kaggle. The dataset contains job listings in US from Glassdoor. The CSV file contains Job title, salart estimate, job description, company name, company rating, company headquarters, company size, and more.
