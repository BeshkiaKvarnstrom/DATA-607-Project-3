However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.
One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards.

Ideal candidates should have a strong interest in criminal justice research, excellent data science skills, and proven expertise with commonly used data science tools, such as SQL, R, and Python. Among other data sources, the position involves working with a highly complicated relational database that integrates data from both criminal justice agencies and nonprofit service providers. The definition of success is grasping what types of measures it is essential to track and analyze; coding in SQL and R to create such measures and merge them with others to create analysis-ready datasets; and having the necessary attention to detail to create informative results that are visually and conceptually clear to policymakers and practitioners.
Although the primary assignment would be to the MOCJ project, the applicant would also likely maintain at least one assignment at all times resulting in independent DCJ research publications, with subjects along the lines of those represented under the “Our Work” tab of our website. This added work may be delayed at the start of the position to prioritize database progress for MOCJ.

Data Scientist [NYC],https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=d42a40a11d675cc9&fccid=cc9736530099397d&vjs=3,,,,"Do you want to work on the most pressing problem of our generation?
We're building the infrastructure for the net zero transition, and we're looking for brilliant builders who want to help define a low carbon future.
Decarbonizing the economy requires a granular, real-time view of where emissions come from and how they might be reduced. We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives. Having developed technology which is significant in advance of competitive solutions, we are now investing heavily in market adoption.
You can find out more about interviewing at CarbonChain at https://www.carbonchain.com/careers/interview-process.
Working at CarbonChain
To join CarbonChain, you'll be a keen team player who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we've run Amazon's European supply chain, built JustEat's corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We've got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there's a lot we don't know, and we're hoping you can help fill that gap.
We encourage every member of our team to be the best they can be, whether that's developing skills through their learning budget or participating in reading groups. Our work requires everybody to straddle the physical and digital worlds, and a growth mindset is essential.
What will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain?
As the world wakes up to the reality of climate change and the need to decarbonize, there's a pressing need to understand the carbon intensity of every activity in the economy. Your job as Data Scientist is to build the datasets, models, and pipelines we need to provide that understanding, and get insights to clients.
As the first Data Science hire in the NYC office, you'll help form the team in NYC and collaborate closely with London. Your work will directly contribute to the acquisition and success of North American clients, whilst helping to shape the product to meet the needs of a new market.
This is a role that will involve lots of contact with clients and close collaboration with the sales team. We're looking for a commercially-minded data scientist who is curious about discovering and solving customer problems.
You can expect to have:
Ownership of your projects
Extensive client exposure
The ability to make real changes with tangible business value
Our data science stack is predominantly Python. We deploy our work in a variety of ways depending upon the challenge, from Lambdas to Docker containers. A typical service might pull together a mix of data from relational and non-relational databases, train a machine learning model nightly, and expose predictions via a Lambda function. We've got a huge number of exciting things to build, from interactive visualizations of industrial processes to fluid-dynamics models of shipping emissions.
Our only must-haves are possessing a hunger to solve business challenges using technology and the ability to build close relationships with your team.
Which tools, technologies, and processes will you work with?
Data processing with the standard scientific stack (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy) and beyond
Machine learning in Sklearn and (rarely) Pytorch
Data visualization with Plotly, Maptlotlib, and Altair
Containerised applications are the key to our technology vision allowing us to replicate production environments locally and scale services at will.
Object-oriented code forms the bulk of our codebase.
PostgreSQL and DynamoDB managed databases form the persistence layer - you'll learn to navigate document and relational databases and appreciate the values in both worlds.
Infrastructure automation is owned by the whole team, helping to spread the DevOps mentality across the whole technology department (and beyond).
Testing approaches from unit testing to integration testing are key to delivering reliable and maintainable solutions.
Quality assurance is owned by the team themselves - we believe that full cycle product ownership should sit tightly within the team.
Agile development, using various approaches from Scrum to Elephant Carpaccio, helps us deliver software in small iterations, learning and course-correcting in the process to make sure we deliver the right improvements.
GitHub PRs are an integral part of our core development flow - with reviews to help share knowledge and improve quality.
Continuous delivery is the approach we strive for - with metrics that help us optimise parts of the pipeline that need it the most.
Teamwork and collaboration are fundamental to the delivery of our solutions. We encourage solutionizing between the team and the wider business.
You don't need to be a pro at all of these skills to apply for the role, but we'd love to hear about any relevant knowledge and experiences that you have in these areas.
What we require from applicants
Right to work in the US and willingness to come to the NYC office 2+ days a week
4+ years of relevant work experience
A passion for environmental issues
A demonstrated interest in building products and collaborating tightly with engineers
The grit and energy to work in an early stage startup
What we're offering
Healthcare
Competitive salary + generous equity package
Flexible working hours - we encourage regular breaks and being AFK (away from keyboard) to support your wellbeing
$2,000 annual development allowance for you to spend on developing your current skills and learning new things
Tech equipment of your choice
Regular social activities
Generous amount of holidays, 26 days of annual leave
We're striving to build a diverse team and we would love to hear from applicants from backgrounds less frequently represented in technology, be that in terms of gender, race, or professional background.
If you think your skills and experience match what we're looking for and you'd like to join a Carbon Tech industry unicorn, please get in touch!",

ABOUT THE ROLE
Our Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients. As a Staff Data Scientist, you will contribute meaningfully through leading others.
Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges.
You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.
Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our Data Scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR
You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to complex, multi-layered, impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing and anticipate problems that may be several degrees removed from obvious requirements.
You make your team better by proactively advocating for and driving improvements not just to what the team produces, but also the ways in which the team works.
You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled data scientist with deep expertise working with embedded models in always-on production systems and working across a variety of technologies and data sources.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE
You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
Preferred, a BS/MS with 12 years or a PhD with 8+ years of experience working in a data-driven role. What is most important to us is what and how you can contribute though which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.
You make effective use of big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

The Roku Culture
Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.
