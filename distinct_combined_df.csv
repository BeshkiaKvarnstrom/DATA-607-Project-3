Who We’re Looking For (Position Overview):




We are on the search for a Population Health Data Analyst to join our team in San Diego. The mission of Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) is to optimize the health of its beneficiaries through critically needed Public Health programs. In order to optimize the performance in support of accomplishing its mission, the Public Health program requires the services of data analyst services to provide real-time information. This contract and its respective deliverables will support NMCSD in ensuring that its Public Health mission is met.




What Your Day-To-Day Looks Like (Position Responsibilities):




The Employee shall participate in preparing, reviewing and presenting briefings, memos and white papers in support of San Diego Public Health efforts. It is expected that NMCSD Public Health briefings will be prepared and delivered to NMCSD, BUMED, DHA and/or MHS leadership approximately every 6-8 weeks. Presentations and briefings will normally be delivered by the government lead; however there may be occasions when the Employee will be expected to deliver presentations as a back-up to the government lead or co-present certain sections of the presentations developed by the Employee. The Employee will normally attend all briefings with the government lead unless designated as government only. Additionally ad-hoc briefings and presentations for other external stakeholders (i.e., conferences, partner meetings, etc.) are anticipated to occur every 4-6 months and may require contract support in the development of content for such briefings and presentations
Assisting in the review, development, and implementation of processes and guidelines for all primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention modalities developed for NMCSD staff. Processes and guidelines will be developed and updated on a continuous basis throughout the duration of the contract on a bi-weekly basis
Providing analytic and presentation development support to NMCSD personnel participating in medical meetings, committees, professional associations, boards, and other related groups as necessary to support San Diego Public Health strategy development and implementation efforts. These events are anticipated to occur every 3-6 months
Maintain annual occupational health readiness and screening in accordance with NMCSD occupational guidelines
Maintain current training requirements as required by NMCSD (e.g. HIPAA, Information Assurance)
The Employee shall update and maintain a current electronic repository of San Diego Public Health documents and materials on the San Diego Public Health internal SharePoint site in accordance with guidelines and established procedures. This repository currently exists as a stand-alone Public Health SharePoint website on the NMCSD network, accessible through CAC access. Initial update due 30 DACA and updated weekly thereafter
The Employee shall manage existing Tertiary Prevention patient identification approaches through the use of advanced statistical software (such as Statistical Analysis Software). The existing approach involves running a query each month on the prior 12 months full history of San Diego TRICARE beneficiary claims data as reported in the M2 database. The Employee shall enhance the existing Tertiary Prevention Population Identification algorithms in order to further refine mechanisms to identify select specific High Utilizer patients. Performance on this task will be measured by the completion of monthly algorithms for identifying tertiary beneficiaries. In order to perform this task, the Government will grant the Employee query access to the M2 and MDR database. The Employee shall establish a data sharing agreement with the government prior to being granted access to the M2 and MDR database. Employee will have a data sharing agreement with the government completed before the contract award
The Employee shall create data-driven algorithms that will analyze patient claims and encounters data, as well as data sourced from local directories provided by NMCSD (i.e., health and wellness program enrollment rosters) to select patients or patient groups best suited for Primary, Secondary or Tertiary Interventions. Primary and Secondary interventions are defined as programs that help TRICARE beneficiaries manage and/or prevent disease and risk factors before they lead to the need for acute medical services. Specific algorithms for identifying beneficiaries for Primary and Secondary intervention have not yet been developed, and should be developed in a manner that will ultimately allow for them to be transitioned to government staff at NMCSD.

"Linkedin","Data Engineer","First Street Foundation","Brooklyn"," NY","Our Goal

Ensure no property is bought, sold, held, or rented without an accurate, property specific climate risk assessment.







The Problem

The problem with climate risk today is that there is no easy, accurate, accessible, and trusted way to understand physical climate risk at a property level. Climate based disasters cause billions in property damage every year and are increasing dramatically. The best science highlighting the issue is complex, happening in silos, and left in peer reviewed journals. Because of this, millions of Americans are making the biggest investment decision of their lives without a true understanding of their risk.




Risk Factor (riskfactor.com) solves this problem for flooding, wildfire, and extreme heat and we are just getting started. Not only do we have millions of users, in two short years we have seen Risk Factor integrated with top real estate websites like Realtor.com, adopted by 30+ Federal government agencies, used daily by top institutional investors like Nuveen, and leveraged in portfolio analysis by all Federal Reserve Banks.







The Opportunity

We have started a revolution in climate risk data, we have proven product market fit, and we have millions in ARR while still staying true to our non-profit climate mission. We are trailblazing a path to create a new philanthropic model that moves away from donors and is entirely self-sustaining ensuring predictable revenue and continued growth and impact. It is with this foundation that we want to supercharge growth. To do this, we are looking for an expert Data Engineer to join our team.







The Role

The Data Engineer must be someone who deeply cares about the environment, loves information technology, and appreciates the importance of data for the success of the First Street mission. The Data Engineer will lead the ingestion of climate risk and ancillary data from First Street modeling and data partners, develop data pipelines, manage geospatial databases, calculate applicable statistics, implement Quality Assurance and Quality Control processes, utilize geographical imagery, and ensure that the Data Team’s databases and pipelines are coordinated and synchronized with the Software Engineering Team’s databases, APIs, and web services. This individual will be responsible for developing data operations across the Data Team, and through their expertise and leadership generally enabling all members of the Data Team to be successful in their roles.







What’s in it for you?

For your hard work you will be rewarded with a competitive salary, bonuses based on company growth goals, generous paid time off, a stipend to deck out your home workstation and the opportunity to work for the most trafficked climate risk website in the country.




Responsibilities will include, but are not limited to:

"Linkedin","Data Collection Specialist","FAO","Home"," KS","Organizational Setting

The Animal Production and Health Division (NSA) promotes and facilitates the sustainable development of the livestock sector, integrating scientific, technical expertise and policy advice. It hosts technical networks in areas of animal genetics, feed and pastoralism, among others. It provides analysis and technical assistance, and facilitates policy dialogue (incl. intergovernmental bodies).

The consultancy is located in the Animal Production and Genetics Branch (NSAG). The Unit generates information and manages knowledge, facilitates the development and implementation of innovative solutions and provides technical expertise to improve productivity, efficiency and resilience of livestock production. The activities of the Unit cover all production systems, from pastoralism to industrial, including crop-livestock integrated systems; and aim to enhance their sustainability.

Reporting Lines

Under the direct supervision of the NSAG Animal Production Officer, and in close consultation and collaboration with relevant colleagues in FAO HQ and decentralized offices and partners, the incumbent will support NSAG’s work related to data collection for the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS).

Technical Focus

Population size is a valuable indicator of a breed’s risk of extinction, which is used for the computation of SDG Indicator 2.5.2. Breed-based censuses and to a certain extent herdbooks for pedigree registration are accurate tools for monitoring breed population sizes, but are generally costly, require important logistic and governance capacities, and are not available for most breed populations in developing countries and for many breeds in developed countries, especially for certain species.

Estimating population size by sampling and/or other approaches is a relatively inexpensive approach that, when properly applied, still yields reasonably accurate results. FAO has already developed some methods for estimating population sizes of breeds and tested them in several countries. However, these methods are not appropriate in all circumstances, and further innovation is needed. Methods for estimating colony numbers are also needed to monitor the diversity of managed honey bees. The technical focus is on developing low-cost and cost-effective methods for estimating the size of breed populations in livestock species and the number of bee-colonies.

Tasks And Responsibilities

Provide a literature and technical review of methods on estimation of breed population sizes including the one developed by FAO based on stratified-sampling considering the desired precision of estimates, the degree of accuracy and related costs.
Participate in one mission to FAO HQ to meet relevant colleagues and partners.
Develop a structured questionnaire that helps to collect information on implementation constraints, challenges experienced, and solutions found related to collection/estimation of breed population size data. This should be based on the literature review developed under the first bullet.
Conduct structured interviews (online or onsite) to gather information on implementation constraints, challenges experienced, and solutions found related to collection/estimation of breed population size data.
Based on the literature review and through the analysis of the information collected through the task above, prepare a document presenting alternative methods to estimate population sizes of breeds and the number of bee colonies for monitoring purpose, describing prerequisites for implementation and costs in relation to precision and degree of accuracy of the estimates.
Draft a step-by-step guide on the implementation of selected alternative low-cost methods in the field.
Assist in identifying countries and Service Providers for testing the proposed methods in the field.
Perform other duties as required.

CANDIDATES WILL BE ASSESSED AGAINST THE FOLLOWING

Minimum Requirements

Job Description:

We are looking for a detail-oriented Data Entry Specialist to join our Venue Research team in Henderson, Nevada.

Who We Are

In 2007, two pretty sharp brothers decided to bootstrap a new business venture using their poker winnings to fund it. A week before inception, one brother got a fox red Labrador retriever puppy and named him Red. He quickly became the center of their universe and the name Red Dog Media was officially born.

Today, Red Dog Media focuses on internet marketing; specifically performance marketing, search engine marketing, landing page optimization, and conversion rate optimization. What started with four employees has grown to over 40 people over the past 15 years.

Culture + Core Values

Our core values are woven throughout our entire interview process in order to gauge whether a candidate is a good cultural fit.

Be a Championship Teammate - While a ""team player"" is collegial, a champion teammate is much more. They have the drive to succeed, work hard, come prepared, hold themselves accountable to high standards, elevate those around them, and are coachable.

Be Better Than Yesterday - Do you bring more skills to the table today than a year ago? How do you plan to be better a year from now? We work in a fast-paced competitive industry. If we stagnate, we’ll get left behind. This applies at the company and personal level. Growth and improvement need not be only in technical skill sets; personal growth can be even more valuable.

Pay: $55,000 / year

Schedule: Full time

Job Description:

We are looking for a detail-oriented Data Entry Specialist to join our Venue Research team in Henderson, Nevada.

Who We Are

In 2007, two pretty sharp brothers decided to bootstrap a new business venture using their poker winnings to fund it. A week before inception, one brother got a fox red Labrador retriever puppy and named him Red. He quickly became the center of their universe and the name Red Dog Media was officially born.

Today, Red Dog Media focuses on internet marketing; specifically performance marketing, search engine marketing, landing page optimization, and conversion rate optimization. What started with four employees has grown to over 40 people over the past 15 years.

Culture + Core Values

Our core values are woven throughout our entire interview process in order to gauge whether a candidate is a good cultural fit.

Be a Championship Teammate - While a ""team player"" is collegial, a champion teammate is much more. They have the drive to succeed, work hard, come prepared, hold themselves accountable to high standards, elevate those around them, and are coachable.

Be Better Than Yesterday - Do you bring more skills to the table today than a year ago? How do you plan to be better a year from now? We work in a fast-paced competitive industry. If we stagnate, we’ll get left behind. This applies at the company and personal level. Growth and improvement need not be only in technical skill sets; personal growth can be even more valuable.
